## SEB - MULIPLICATION USING FUNCTION
---

### AIM  
To write a python program to define a function named "result" that accepts 3  values and return its  multiplication.

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Start
2. Input three integers: a, b, and c
3. Define a function result(a, b, c) that returns the product: a * b * c
4. Call the function with the input values: result(a, b, c)
5. Print the result with a message: "Multiply is" followed by the product
6. End

---

### PROGRAM

```
def result(a,b,c):
    return a*b*c
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
print("Multiply is",result(a,b,c))
```
