## BUILT-IN FUNCTIONS AND LAMBDA FUNCTIONS - ADDING THREE NUMBERS

---

### AIM  
To write a function which takes three arguments: a and b and c and returns the addition of them: a+b+c. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python

---

### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.
2. Input three integers: Read values a, b, and c from the user.
3. Define a lambda function f that takes three arguments and returns their sum: f = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
4. Call the lambda function using f(a, b, c)
5. Print the result of the function call (i.e., the sum of the three numbers) 
6. Terminate the program.

---

### PROGRAM

```pyhton
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
c=int(input())
f=lambda a,b,c:a+b+c
print(f(a,b,c))
```

### RESULT

```
Thus the a function which takes three arguments: a and b and c and returns the addition of them: a+b+c. Assign it to a variable named: f. using python was implemented and executed successfully.
